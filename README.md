# Final project for BIGDATA analytics course

The goal of the project is to analyse different classes of regressors in Sci-kit Learn to predict the size of a melanoma tumour from the provided data from labarotatory measurements of skin patches affected by the tumour. 

Unfortunately, the data is not intuitive for me and doesn't have an extensive description, so my best guess would be to assume all features have similar meaning and we don't transform or engineer new features.
